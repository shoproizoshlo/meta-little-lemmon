## Overview

### About the final project assessment

Using React you put your skills into practice to build a web app for the Little Lemon restaurant. You demonstrated your web development skills by writing code to create a form that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant. When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will evaluate the following:

- Has the learner followed the design and implementation of the UX UI?
- Are there appropriate accessibility tags applied?
- Is the booking form functional and applying validation?
- Are the semantics and responsiveness of the web app correct?
- Has the learner committed the project to a Git repository?
